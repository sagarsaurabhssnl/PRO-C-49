            <h3>Facts</h3>
            <li>When camels walk, they move both legs on one side of their body and then the other.</li><br>
            <li>Their feet are also soft, flat and wide.</li><br>
            <li>Both of these features help prevent them from sinking into the sand.</li><br>
            <li>Camels have a double row of very long eyelashes to protect the eye from blowing sand.</li><br>
            <li>They also have a nictitating membrane, which is a third eyelid for extra protection from sand and dust.
            </li><br>
            <li>They have hairs in the opening of the ear to help stop blowing sand from blowing into them.</li><br>
            <li>Camels can also close their nostrils.

            <h3>Facts</h3>
            <li>The largest chameleon is the Parson’s chameleon, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.</li><br>
            <li>It can grow up to 27 inches (69.5 centimeters) long.</li><br>
            <li>The Madagascan, also known as the Oustalet's chameleon, is also very large and grows up to 23 inches (60
                cm) long.</li><br>
            <li>Chameleons have eyes in the backs of their heads</li><br>
            <li>Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body.</li><br>

            <h3>Facts</h3>
            <li>Cicadas are famous for their penchant for disappearing entirely for many years, only to reappear in
                force at a regular interval.</li><br>
            <li>There are four species of 13-year cicadas: Magicicada tredecim, Magicicada neotredecim, Magicicada
                tredecassini, and Magicicada tredecula.</li><br>
            <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.
            </li><br>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the
                lookout.</li><br>
            <li>Cicadas are mostly beneficial. They prune mature trees, aerate the soil, and once they die, their bodies
                serve as an important source of nitrogen for growing trees.</li><br>

            <h3>Facts</h3>
            <li>An adult panda weight more than 45 kilos (100 pounds), and can be about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Giant pandas can't stand and do kung fu moves like Po in Kungfu Panda. But they are good tree climbers.
                They can climb trees from 7 months old.</li><br>
            <li>Pandas are born looking like baby badgers — fur-less, pink, and blind. The iconic black and white colour
                comes later, after about three weeks.</li><br>
            <li>Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their
                diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin,
                kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. </li><br>
            <li>As about all a panda does all day is eat and sleep, you are best to get up early</li><br>

            <h3>Facts</h3>
            <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li><br>
            <li>In a 2017 Current Biology study, researchers showed captive pigeons a series of digital lines on a
                computer screen for either two or eight seconds.</li><br>
            <li>Some lines were short, measuring about 2.3 inches across; others were four times longer.</li><br>
            <li>The pigeons were trained to evaluate either the length of the line or how long it was displayed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>They found that the more time a line was displayed, the longer in length the pigeon judged it to be.

            <h3>Facts</h3>
            <li>The name teddy bear comes from former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, who was commonly known
                as "Teddy".</li><br>
            <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902
                hunting trip.</li><br>
            <li>The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</li><br>
            <li>Bears first appeared on the literary scene in the fairy tale 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears' written by
                Robert Southey in 1834.</li><br>
            <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school
                project.</li><br>
